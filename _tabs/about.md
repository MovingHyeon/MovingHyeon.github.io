Now undergraduate in statistics, double majoring economics, at Seoul National University. Major research fields are still being explored, including data analyzing techniques such as developing interpretable deep learning models, addressing a variety of social problems with data science, and developing background theory on those researches in probabilistic sense. Specifically, developing the sights of Bayesian approaches and being used to expressions in probability theory are the main streams of recent challenges. In addition, being familiar with deep learning involving neural networks and other machine learning tools is another primary goal within a year. Altogether, these learnings will help address fundamentals to advanced practical issues in terms of data science.

To examine and explore questions motivated by the matters of the social component in the discipline of statistics, it came to my mind that at least some part of understanding them is mandatory(though most theoretical concepts on statistics seemingly rely solely on mathematical notions and computations). Intriguing economic questions are the accompaniments of complicated human interests, and statistical methods provide primary keys to deal with them. Hence simple hopes that my aggregated statistical sense triggers to unravel all sorts of economic and other social problems wish to come true.

Riding a bike, playing guitar, listening to band music, looking for special spots such as cafe with magnificent interior, taking pictures, and other weird stuffs are my special hobbies.
